## The problem

Because art or design works are not popular yet and have a very small community. It will be referenced by the Asian society in which the adult is nowadays. Still do not support the value of the work of art much. As a result, there are no applications for art trading, most people will be directed to private groups such as Facebook. This app is aimed at people who love art or designers who can come and sell freely and easily use it. Moreover, nowadays, more and more people like to trade online, because the changing behaviour, including the Covid-19 period, made the trading online market very much in demand. That is one of the key reasons why this application was created. It was reaching the target audience at the right moment and there was not much market involved in purchasing art. That makes it easy for us to reach out to users and possibly get word of mouth.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

If based on the problem mentioned above, there is a target audience but not a wide enough market for the general public to try to sell their artworks. The V-Space app itself is like an online marketplace for designers, whether digital or artwork can be sold here. Why creating an application that is a Marketplace is a solution to the problem, it can be compared that if there is a buyer, then there must be a seller. The fact that V-Space has become an intermediary means people who want to sell more of their work, be it a professional or a hobbyist. Makes the value of the artwork more valuable by showing that there is someone who wants to buy it through V-Space That is, a factor that is not just a Marketplace application, but also a support point for the designer's work.
