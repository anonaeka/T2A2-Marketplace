## The problem

Because art or design works are not popular yet and have a very small community. It will be referenced by the Asian society in which the adult is nowadays. Still do not support the value of the work of art much. As a result, there are no applications for art trading, most people will be directed to private groups such as Facebook. This app is aimed at people who love art or designers who can come and sell freely and easily use it. Moreover, nowadays, more and more people like to trade online, because the changing behaviour, including the Covid-19 period, made the trading online market very much in demand. That is one of the key reasons why this application was created. It was reaching the target audience at the right moment and there was not much market involved in purchasing art. That makes it easy for us to reach out to users and possibly get word of mouth.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

If based on the problem mentioned above, there is a target audience but not a wide enough market for the general public to try to sell their artworks. The V-Space app itself is like an online marketplace for designers, whether digital or artwork can be sold here. Why creating an application that is a Marketplace is a solution to the problem, it can be compared that if there is a buyer, then there must be a seller. The fact that V-Space has become an intermediary means people who want to sell more of their work, be it a professional or a hobbyist. Makes the value of the artwork more valuable by showing that there is someone who wants to buy it through V-Space That is, a factor that is not just a Marketplace application, but also a support point for the designer's work.

## Purpose

The purpose of V-space is to be an online marketplace application targeted at freelance or professional designers. To support their work V-space will allow various art designers to multiply and dare to follow their dreams. The design of the app is minimal, easy to use, suitable for the lifestyle of designers. Moreover, it is one of the contributions that allow me to develop my skills in making applications in the form of online marketplaces.

## Target audience

From practitioners to professional designers who want to find a way to showcase and sell their work. Whether the user likes to design as a hobby or a professional to create a fabulous portfolio. You can use the V-space online marketplace service. It is a place to sell works and a showcase for all kinds of designers.

### Gems

It is a gem that is used for making authentication With its capabilities that allow us to log in by using built-in commands. Forms, subscription or login forms, including editing personal information and deleting of the user account.

### Framework

A framework that makes web design easier and simple to use. It is the main visual factor of the V-Space website. This feature will not require a lot of complicated swatches because Bootstrap brings ready-made code to use.

An easy-to-use page organizer with no coding hassles. Because it is a ready-made Gem with easy and ready-to-use commands.

### Unused gem
* *[rolify](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)*
Initially, V-Space had a plan to use a rolify gem, but due to user needs, there was no need to set the user roll. So I uninstalled it and just using Devise was enough for V-Space.
